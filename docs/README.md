## Tech Stack

### <u>Front End</u>

Technologies Used: React, Javascript, HTML5, TailwindCSS

<img src="https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-co226-Online-Learning-Platform/assets/115539769/ad663d60-b7bd-4703-9b33-7a2b4837e536" width=250 />

#### React :
- React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the dynamic rendering of data-driven views in web applications.

#### JavaScript :
- JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development.
- It enables interactive and dynamic content on websites, offering capabilities for both front-end and back-end development through frameworks like <b>Node.js.</b>

#### Tailwind CSS :
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-designed classes to style elements.
- It enables rapid UI design and customization while promoting consistency in styling across projects.

#### HTML5 :
- HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, used to structure and present content on the web.
- It introduces new features like semantic elements, multimedia support, and improved forms for enhanced user experiences.

### <u>Back End</u>

Technologies Used: Springboot, Node.js, MySQL

#### Spring Boot :
- Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the process of building production-ready web applications.
- It provides a set of tools and conventions for rapid development and easy configuration.

#### Node.js :
- Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- It allows developers to build scalable and high-performance network applications, making it well-suited for creating real-time web applications.

#### MySQL :
- MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
- It is widely used for storing and managing structured data in various types of applications, from small websites to large enterprise systems.

## Connecting Spring Boot with React:

1. API Endpoints:
- Spring Boot defines a set of API endpoints that the React frontend can call.
- These endpoints are usually implemented using controllers and mapped to specific URLs.
- Each endpoint corresponds to a specific action, such as retrieving data, updating information, or submitting forms.

2. HTTP Requests:
- React frontend uses various HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to send requests to the Spring Boot backend.
- For instance, when fetching data, React sends a GET request to the appropriate endpoint. When submitting a form, it might send a POST request with the form data.

3. Data Transfer:
- Data is transferred between the frontend and backend using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
- Spring Boot serializes and deserializes JSON data to Java objects, while React uses JavaScript objects to work with the data.

4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
- Due to security restrictions in web browsers, frontend and backend may be hosted on different domains.
- CORS headers need to be properly configured on the backend to allow cross-origin requests from the React frontend.

5. State Management:
- React manages its own state using tools like React's built-in state or third-party libraries like Redux.
- The backend manages its own state and data storage, such as in a database.
